### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I have flown helicopters and coordinated close air support as a Marine Corps Pilot and Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC). More recently, for the past 7+ years, I was a Lead Program Manager for a Fortune 200 supply chain services company. Now, I am a full stack software developer. 

My goal is to begin a career in technology as a junior software developer, building a technical proficiency that will allow me to, one day, become an effective leader in product and software development/ management. 

My career may seem disjointed, but it's only fitting for someone who loves to find meaningful connections to seemingly disparate parts of complex systems. Helicopter components, numbers, or people and their incentives: they all have brilliantly unique characteristics that only shine when they are powerfully connected through purpose. 

I have always been able to recognize and task-organize available resources to achieve an objective, especially one that I could not handle alone. But it was not until I started coding that I saw this as preparation for object oriented programming: curating objects from data types, making intelligence out of information, and creating efficiency by removing waste and adding value...

Purpose, out of otherwise meaningless potential, in order to accomplish a mission.
