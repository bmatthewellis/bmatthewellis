### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on a career transition.  After 10 years in the Marine Corps and another 8 years in business operations management, I am exploring opportunities in software development.

Beginning this journey as a student, I am learning to become a junior software developer by studying Java at Tech Elevator's Pittsburgh Campus beginning in May 2023.
